# 🍽️ Restaurant OOP System

## 📘 Overview
A simple restaurant management system built to demonstrate the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
**Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

The system simulates customers placing dine-in and delivery orders, processing payments, and updating balances.

---

## 🧩 OOP Concepts
- **Encapsulation** – Protects customer data using private attributes and controlled access.  
- **Abstraction** – Defines a general payment interface that hides complex logic.  
- **Inheritance** – Reuses shared order behavior across dine-in and delivery types.  
- **Polymorphism** – Executes different behaviors using the same method calls.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `main.py` → Runs the full system  
- `customer.py` → Demonstrates encapsulation  
- `payment_method.py` → Demonstrates abstraction  
- `orders.py` → Demonstrates inheritance  
- `process_orders.py` → Demonstrates polymorphism

---

## 🌿 Branching
- `main` → Stable final version  
- `init/oop-files` → Initial empty setup  
- `feature/oop-implementation` → Active development branch

---

## 💡 Summary
This project shows how OOP principles make code **modular, reusable, and easy to maintain**, using a real-world restaurant example.
